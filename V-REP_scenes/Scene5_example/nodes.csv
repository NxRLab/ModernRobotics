# nodes.csv file for V-REP kilobot motion planning scene.
# All lines beginning with a # are treated as a comment and ignored.
# Each line below has the form
# ID,x,y,heuristic-cost-to-go
# where ID is the unique integer ID number of the node (1 through N),
# (x,y) is the location of the node in the plane, and heuristic-cost-to-go
# is an optimistic estimate of the path length from that node to the
# goal node, as needed by A* search.
